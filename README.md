# Intro-pal
Intro-pal is a collaborative project aimed at helping contributors practice version control using Git and GitHub. Each participant adds their name and introduction to the introduction.txt file as a way of learning how to contribute to a shared project.

# Branches
This repository uses two main branches:
- main: This branch represents the production environment where the final version of the project is deployed.
- dev: This branch is used for feature development. Contributors create new branches from dev to add their features, which are later merged back into dev after review.
